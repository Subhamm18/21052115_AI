# Genetic Algorithm Image Generation 🧬🖼️

This project showcases the magic of genetic algorithms to generate captivating images using squares. The algorithm evolves a population of square configurations to approximate a given target image. 🌟

## Getting Started 🚀

These instructions will help you set up and run the genetic algorithm to create artful images using squares. You can run this project in a Jupyter notebook, Google Colab, or your local Python environment. 🖥️

### Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you embark on this creative journey, ensure you have the following enchantments installed:

- OpenCV (for image processing) 🌆
- DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) 🧬
- NumPy (for numerical wizardry) 🧙

You can install these enchantments using pip:

```shell
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install deap
pip install numpy
```

### Running the Genetic Algorithm 🧪

Follow these steps to cast your spell with the genetic algorithm:

1. Clone the repository to your local realm:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genetic-algorithm-image-generation.git
   ```

2. Enter the project's mystical realm:

   ```shell
   cd genetic-algorithm-image-generation
   ```

3. Replace the `target_image` variable with the image you desire to summon. You can specify the target image's dimensions in the `width` and `height` variables.

4. Customize the `generate_individual`, `custom_crossover`, and `custom_mutation` spells to define how squares are conjured, intertwined, and transformed. The provided code includes placeholders.

5. Invoke the main script:

   ```shell
   python genetic_algorithm.py
   ```

6. The genetic algorithm will cast its spells for a specified number of generations, and the most enchanting image approximation will be unveiled at each generation. 🌌

## Customization 🪄

You hold the wand to customize the genetic algorithm and the image creation process. Modify the provided spells and parameters to experiment with different enchantments, unlocking your own magical results. 🌠
